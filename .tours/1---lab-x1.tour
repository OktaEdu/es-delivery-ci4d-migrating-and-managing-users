They want customers to be able to sign in with their existing passwords. Since the passwords are hashed and salted, they can import these in bulk using Okta's Users API.\n\n‚è±Ô∏è **Duration** 20 minutes"

We'll do this by duplicating a similar request, renaming it, and modifying the body of the request.\n\n1. Open Postman\n\n2. Ensure your Environment is set to the environment you created in Module 3. It should have the same name as your Okta org.\n\n3. Expand the `Users (Okta API)` collection\n\n4. Expand the `Create User` folder\n\n5. Right click on `Create Activated User with Password` and select `Duplicate`\n\n6. In the new API request tab that opens, hover your mouse over the title (`Create Activated User with Password Copy`) and the pencil icon that appears.\n\n7. Rename this API request `Create User with Imported Hashed Password`\n\n8. Click `Save`"

We are going to be sending data via the request body.\n\n2. Delete the contents of the request body.\n\n3. Copy the following JSON and paste it into the request body:\n\n```\n{\n  \"profile\": {\n    \"firstName\": \"Hashem\",\n    \"lastName\": \"Pesar\",\n    \"email\": \"hashem.pesar@{{email-suffix}}\",\n    \"login\": \"hashem.pesar@{{email-suffix}}\",\n    \"userType\": \"customer\"\n  },\n\"credentials\": {\n    \"password\" : {\n      \"hash\": {\n        \"algorithm\": \"BCRYPT\",\n        \"workFactor\": 12,\n        \"salt\": \"S77ORXjoSbjRMdvG/Yvc0u\",\n        \"value\": \"x6WB1d4z5BjpeuyANyVWZqBbIfCq24q\"\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThis will import our existing user with a username of `hashem.pesar@oktaice.com` and their existing password that was previously hashed using the bcrypt algorithm with the salt provided. Notice that we also specify a `userType` of `customer` so that our existing Group Rule (Lab 1.2) will assign this user to the `Customers` group. This will give this user access to the customer apps."

      "description": "## ‚úÖ Checkpoint\n\nAt this point, you have successfully imported an existing customer with their hashed password into Okta! In a real-world scenario, you would import users in bulk.\n\nOkta employs built-in rate limit controls designed to protect the Okta service from the negative impacts that high traffic levels can create. This enables Okta to maintain service uptime and stability. As a result, during heavy usage periods an Okta tenant might experience traffic spikes that cause rate limits to go into effect. To avoid having rate limits impact your migration it‚Äôs suggested that you work with Okta support to plan your user migration during a time when rate limits can be temporarily adjusted and identify what the available options are for doing so.\n\n### üéâ End of Module 6 Labs\n\n**You may close this workspace project, ensuring all changes were saved.**"
